# TidyTuesday: HIV/AIDS Mortality Rate Trends in Southern Africa

## Overview
This visualization explores HIV/AIDS Mortality Rate Trends from 1990 to 2016.

## Key Findings
- Mortality rates from HIV/AIDS in countries like Botswana, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe were among the highest globally, reaching over 40% at their peak during the late 1990s and early 2000s, but have steadily decreased since then.

- The countries highlighted with the highest mortality rates also showed the most rapid and consistent declines, suggesting successful public health interventions and wider access to treatments like antiretroviral therapy in recent years.

- By 2016, the differences in mortality between these high-burden countries and other sub-Saharan African nations had narrowed, yet Botswana, Swaziland, and South Africa remained among those with relatively higher rates of HIV/AIDS-related deaths.
