# TidyTuesday: The Turnout Gap That Defines United States Election Cycles

## Overview
Line chart showing US voter turnout rate from 1980 to 2014, highlighting the persistent gap between presidential and midterm elections. Presidential years consistently achieve 30-60% turnout while midterm elections drop to 15-40%. Background shading indicates Republican (red) and Democratic (blue) administrations, with vertical dashed lines marking presidential transitions.

## Key Findings
- **Presidential vs Midterm pattern**: Presidential elections (1980, 1984, 1988, etc.) show significantly higher turnout than midterm elections (1982, 1986, 1990, etc.), creating a clear sawtooth pattern across all administrations.
- **Peak turnout years**: 2004 and 2008 presidential elections reached the highest turnout rates in this period, both exceeding 55%.
- **Consistent midterm drop**: Midterm turnout remained relatively flat (around 15-40%) from 1982 to 2014, showing minimal improvement over three decades.
- **Bipartisan pattern**: The presidential-midterm gap holds steady across both Republican (Reagan, Bush Sr., Bush Jr.) and Democratic (Clinton, Obama) administrations, suggesting systemic factors rather than party-specific mobilization.
- **Obama era**: 2008 showed exceptional turnout but dropped sharply in the 2010 midterm, following the historical pattern.
